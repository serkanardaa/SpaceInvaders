# Space Invaders
The Classic Space Invaders game built in java programming language.

This game is a project of mine that I worked on during my practices on object-oriented programming in java programming language. It has a direct executable file called "Space Invaders.exe" for directly playing.

The control of the game is achieved by arrow buttons and space. Space button works for firing to enemies. Arrow buttons are used for movement.

The code basically consists of a super class "SpaceElement.java" that is used in most of the other classes that are used as objects in the game along with the panel components.
The main file is "game.java" which creates an instance of SpacePanel() which contains the contents of the game.

A presentation "Space Invaders presentation.pptx" is provided in the repository.
